In the context of Support Vector Machines (SVM) in machine learning, SVC and SVR refer to different variants of SVMs designed for classification and regression tasks, respectively. 
SVC (Support Vector Classification):

SVC is the class in sci-kit-learn used for Support Vector Classification. 
It is designed for solving classification problems where the goal is to predict the categorical class labels of instances.
Here, kernel specifies the type of kernel function to be used (e.g., 'linear', 'rbf', 'poly'), and C is the regularization parameter.

SVR (Support Vector Regression):

SVR is the class in scikit-learn used for Support Vector Regression. 
It is an extension of SVM designed for regression tasks where the goal is to predict continuous numeric values instead of discrete class labels.
Similar to SVC, kernel and C are important parameters for SVR. 
The choice of kernel and the regularization parameter C will influence the regression model's performance.
